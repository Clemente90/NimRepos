This is a group of three separate repositories for the Nim 3 compiler. It is a
new Nim language implementation with a new compiler design. Read
(1) `nifspec/doc/nif-spec.md`, (2) `nimony/doc/njvl-spec.md`, and
(3) `nativenif/doc/nifasm.md` so that you know more context.

IMPORTANT! This repository is structured with `git subtree` keep changes and
commits to each sub repo isolated from each other!

You have a Nim compiler version v2.2.6 available. Use it as a baseline for
expected behavior for the Nim verion 3 compiler under development.
